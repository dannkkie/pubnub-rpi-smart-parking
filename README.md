# Smart Parking App with RaspberryPi and PubNub C-Core SDK
Smart Parking System based on Raspberry Pi and PubNub for providing realtime updates on parking availability using the PubNub C-Core SDK.  

##OVERVIEW
This project demonstrates how we can build an application on Raspberry Pi which can control a set of HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors,via AYMega8 chip to detect the availability of a parking slot and update this information on a mobile app using the PubNub's realtime data stream network. This application makes use of the new PubNub C-Core SDK.
